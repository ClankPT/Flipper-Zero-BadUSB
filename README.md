## Description 

⚠️ Please ENJOY and use RESPONSIBLY❗ 


## The Payloads 

This repository has been optimized to facilitate plug and play functionality. 

I use the domain `bit.ly/ClankPT ` for the sole purpose of creating my own short URLs.

I did this with the intention of making room for Discord webhooks and Dropbox tokens to fit in my one-liners.
